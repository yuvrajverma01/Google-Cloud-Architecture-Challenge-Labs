# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

> Launch the lab [here](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/128?utm_source=google&utm_medium=lp&utm_campaign=gcpskills)

## Your challenge

You need to configure this simple environment securely. Your first challenge is to set up appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags. You also need to ensure that SSH is only available to the bastion via IAP.

For the firewall rules, make sure:

- The bastion host does not have a public IP address.
- You can only SSH to the bastion and only via IAP.
- You can only SSH to juice-shop via the bastion.
- Only HTTP is open to the world for `juice-shop`.

## Solving tasks

### Task 1: Remove the overly permissive rules.

* Go to **VPC network** > **Firewall** > will see **open-access**
* Use the following command from the cloud console:

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access
```

### Task 2: Start the bastation host

* Go to **Compute Engine**  > **VM Instances** > Select **bastion** > click on **Start**

### Task 3: Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service.

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create ssh-ingress --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags ssh-ingress --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=ssh-ingress --zone=us-central1-b
```

### Task 4: Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address.

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create http-ingress --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags http-ingress --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=http-ingress --zone=us-central1-b
```

### Task 5: You need to connect to `juice-shop` from the bastion using SSH. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from `acme-mgmt-subnet` network address. The firewall rule should be enabled on `juice-shop` via a network tag

* Run the following:

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create internal-ssh-ingress --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags internal-ssh-ingress --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=internal-ssh-ingress --zone=us-central1-b
```

### Task 6: In the Compute Engine instances page, click the SSH button for the bastion host. Once connected, SSH to `juice-shop`

* Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances** > **SSH** to **bastion** host
* Run the following:
* Look at the **juice-shop** instance and copy its **Internal IP**
* Replace `[internal IP of the juice-shop]` with `copied IP`

```yaml
ssh [internal IP of the juice-shop]
```
